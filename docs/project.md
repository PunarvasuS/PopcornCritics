- Recommendations based on genres of movies listed
- Can search movies by genre, name or above a certain rating
- explanatory pages to learn more about the code and process to do stuff
- random movie generator
- movie guessing game; site outputs movie description (from IMDb API) to user; user has to guess movie title
- api stuff from other reviewers to show their reviews, maybe comparisons
