## Deployment Plan
Mr. Mortensen has kindly created accounts for every group, so we can deploy on his own AWS servers, instead of having to set them up on our own. He will keep them up for a year or so, so next year's AP CS P students can see our websites. We still need to manage our own deployment (upload and update), we just dont need to pay for it. 

### Old Plan:
First, make sure website has at the very least home page as well as navigable pages (not necessarily complete)

Use AWS for grading (in school) period until June.

Work on trying to deploy with a Raspberry Pi during AWS.

Update Deployment every day at 12:00.
