# Popcorn Critics (Group 3)

## [Week 0 Review Ticket](https://github.com/PunarvasuS/PopcornCritics/issues/3)

## Purpose Of Project
Showcase movies and reviews while showing how the website/page was made

## [Github Pages](https://punarvasus.github.io/PopcornCritics/)

### Key Ideas

- movie rating page
- comments
- 'learn more' button that explains code in a dropdown
- "TOP MOVIES" page, gets avg's from movies rated on the site and will list in order from highest to lowest, 10 per page
- Recommendations based on genres of movies listed
- Can search movies by genre, name or above a certain rating
- explanitory pages to learn more about the code and process to do stuff
- rendom movie generator
- movie guessing game; site outputs movie description (from IMDb API) to user; user has to guess movie title

## Purpose Of ReadMe
To organize and highlight our projects through weekly sprints that connect to our PBL. This is shown through commits, tangibles and videos which are organized by the week to showcase work.
