## Key Ideas

- movie rating page
- comments
- 'learn more' button that explains code in a dropdown
- "TOP MOVIES" page, gets mean from movies rated on the site and will list in order from highest to lowest, 10 per page
- Recommendations based on genres of movies listed
- Can search movies by genre, name or above a certain rating
- explanatory pages to learn more about the code and process to do stuff
- random movie generator
- movie guessing game; site outputs movie description (from IMDb API) to user; user has to guess movie title
- api stuff from other reviewers to show their reviews, maybe comparisons
